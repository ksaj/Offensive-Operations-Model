# Offensive-Operations-Model
Meta model / framework I developed in 1999 for Penetration Testing, Forensics, Policy, etc.

Good news for everyone who has been emailing me about this. Finally after years of weighing the pros and cons, we are publishing everything!

There was a lot of experimenting, anf it looks like github, with gists and pages is how we will be doing it.

So, fasten your seatbelts. It is a LOT of data, but it will be going here.
